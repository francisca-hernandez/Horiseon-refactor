# Horiseon-refactor
## Accessibility Optimization of Horiseon Webpage
## Live site at Horiseon Service Challenge
## For this project I took the pre-existing webpage for Horiseon and optimized it for greater accessibility. The original website though functional, lacked alt attributes, proper HTML elements, or a descriptive page title. It also lacked internal documentation and had repetitive classes and a lack of organization. The final page shown here, now is optimized for maximum accessibility with increased SEO. All files include relevant internal documentation, logical CSS organization, optimal use of HTML5 Elements, and clear, consolidated, classes.â€‹

## Key Features
### image alt atributes
### organized CSS by page flow
### concise CSS
### clear internal documentation
### semantic HTML5 elements
### title is clear and concise
